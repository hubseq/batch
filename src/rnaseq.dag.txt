# for simplicity, only one DAG per pipeline for now.
# A > B  indicates that module A runs, then module B (a directed edge from A to B)
# A >? B indicates that B is an optional module (omitting B will not affect rest of pipeline)
# A >+ B indicates that module B must wait for all samples of A to finish (all A nodes have directed edges (sink) into B)
